    <string name="desc_one">While the idea of a safe way home after celebrating has been around for ages, Aber came about in 2024 with a clear mission: to make getting home after a good night out as simple and safe as ordering a pizza. It all started with a personal experience that highlighted the gap between fun nights and responsible choices. We knew there had to be a better way than relying on shaky judgment or pushing friends into uncomfortable situations. And so, Aber was born – a platform that connects responsible designated drivers with those ready to celebrate without the worry of the drive home. Since then, we\'ve grown from a local solution to a nationwide network, all thanks to the amazing community of drivers and riders who prioritize safety and fun in equal measure. We\'re proud to be more than just an app; we\'re a movement pushing for a world where every celebration ends as happily as it begins.</string>
    <string name="desc_two">At Aber, we\'re more than just an app; we\'re a community built on trust and responsibility. We connect neighbors, colleagues, and friends, creating a network of reliable drivers who ensure everyone reaches home safely. By empowering responsible choices, we foster a world where celebration and care go hand-in-hand.</string>
